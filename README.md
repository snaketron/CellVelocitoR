# CellVelocitoR
Quantification of cell velocity using Bayesian probability models

When naming the R-package, I asked ChatGPT the following question: 

I want to create an R-package that quantifies and compares cell velocities using probabilistic 
Bayesian models, but I can't find a good name. Can you give me top-10 suggestions? (Please use 
David Letterman's top 10 list bit please)

ChatGPT
Sure, here are the top 10 suggestions for your R-package name in the classic David Letterman 
Top-10 style:

## Number 10: BayesBolt
Because nothing compares to the speed of Bayesian inference.

## Number 9: ProbCellSpeed
When you need probabilistic precision in cellular velocity.

## Number 8: VelocityViceroy
Rule over cell movement data with Bayesian might.

## Number 7: CellSpeedster
For those times when you need cell speed measured fast and right.

## Number 6: BayesianVelocity
Straightforward and to the point, just like your models.

## Number 5: CellVelocitoR
Because adding an 'R' makes it more R-iffic!

## Number 4: SpeedBayes
Where Bayesian models meet cellular speeds.

## Number 3: VelocityMetrics
Quantify, compare, conquer cell movement data.

## Number 2: ProbabilistiCell
Itâ€™s all about the probability in cell velocity.

## ... and the Number 1 suggestion for your R-package name is: BayesMotion
Harness the power of Bayesian models to measure cell movement!
